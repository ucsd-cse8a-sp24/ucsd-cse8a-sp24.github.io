## Final Exam

_{{ page.released-on }}_

The Final Exam is on Wednesday, June 12th, 8am - 11am. Still waiting for confirmation, but we should be in the same room as lecture (WLH 2001).

We will be having assigned seating and will post them on Sunday before the exam.

For those who have AFA exam accommodation letters, those are all done through the Triton Testing Center. Please sign up for an available time slot immediately to ensure you can find one that fits your schedule.

We are allowing everyone to bring a single 8 1/2" x 11" cheat/note sheet. The cheat sheet will be collected. If you want to get it back after the exam, please put your name and PID on it. Instructions on where to pick them up will be provided after final grades have been posted. Make sure to bring pen/pencil and a picture ID (student ID preferred). 

As stated in the syllabus: No makeup exams will be conducted! No incompletes will be given.

## Topics

All lectures and also includes all PAs.

Importance of Academic Integrity!
- Please donâ€™t cheat!
- Cheating on the final is an automatic F/NP

Final exam format will be similar to the Midterm exam
- Around 80% of questions will be from topics after the midterm
- Around 20% of questions will be from topics before the midterm

NOTE: Plotting will not be tested on the final exam.

## Practice Files

To help you practice, here is a former exam. Our exam will not be exactly like this exam (since we released it publicly we can't ever use it again).

We do not have an answer key for past exams. We suggest working with other students in the course or go to non-busy tutoring times. You can also bring your questions to discussion.
