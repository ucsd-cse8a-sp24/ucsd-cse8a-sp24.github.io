## Final Exam

_{{ page.released-on }}_

The Final Exam is on Monday, June 12th 8am - 11am. Room will be announced in Week 10.

We will be having assigned seating and will post them on Sunday before the exam.

For those who have AFA exam accommodation letters, those are all done through the Triton Testing Center. Please sign up for an available time slot immediately to ensure you can find one that fits your schedule.

We are allowing everyone to bring a single 8 1/2" x 11" cheat/note sheet. The cheat sheet will be collected. If you want to get it back after the exam, please put your name and PID on it. Instructions on where to pick them up will be provided after final grades have been posted. Make sure to bring pen/pencil and a picture ID (student ID preferred). 

## Topics

All lectures and also includes all PAs.

Importance of Academic Integrity!
- Please donâ€™t cheat!

To help you practice, here is a former exam. Our exam will not be exactly like this exam (since we released it publicly we can't ever use it again).

We do not have an answer key for past exams. We suggest working with other students in the course or go to non-busy tutoring times. You can also bring your questions to discussion.
