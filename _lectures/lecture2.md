## Problem Session 2 â€“ Expressions, Data Types, Variables, and Errors

_{{ page.released-on }}_

Readings (should be completed **before** lecture). You will need to make an account on Stepik to have your work saved.
- [Stepik 1.1 - 1.2](https://stepik.org/lesson/567165/step/1?unit=561438){:target="_blank"}

To ensure you get credit for the Stepik exercises, you must fill out this 
[form](https://forms.gle/qRcsGQtHyZRspZXp9){:target="_blank"}
by Friday of Week 2. Starting in Week 3, we will strive to post Stepik grade updates to Canvas every week.

The university requires us to determine which students commence academic activity. Failure to certify academic activity, may result in students being billed for unearned financial aid.

To do this automatically, we are using a survey in Canvas that every student must fill out by the end of Friday of Week 2 to ensure that they are certified.
